# VEHÄ°CLE TRACK SYSTEM
   
   
 ###  _I created a vehicle tracking website for this project. On this site, we will display the profile owner's names, their vehicle information, and the vehicle's location. The site is dynamic and stores newly entered information in a database. We can edit, delete, or add new information to the data in this database. While creating this project, I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and SQL. I utilized the XAMPP application to create my database and managed it using MySQL. You can find videos and photos related to my site below_.
